# NewGeo_FinalProject
This is a submission for a Final Project. It contains a very basic program that would search for a "potential match" given a string of DNA and a blood type. In reality this would be a much more complicated program. I also researched enough to be wise enough to set this repository to private, if not completely delete it afterwards. Thank you for the course.
